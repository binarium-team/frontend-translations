The longer the nose gets, the more likely it is that changes will occur on the chart. The Pinocchio strategy stands out with its simplicity and efficiency. </p><h2>Why Choose This Particular Strategy?</h2><p>The Pinocchio strategy is popular with a wide range of traders, ranging from newcomers to professionals. Clear and simple to use, the strategy is based on frequent signals occurring on the chart and offering a high probability of success. To use this particular strategy in trading, you need a candlestick chart. The aim of the strategy is to look for pin bar candles, or Pinocchios as called by traders.</p><h2>How the Pinocchio Strategy is Used in Trading?</h2><p>First of all, make sure you activate the candlestick chart view. You can do this by choosing the relevant option in the menu bar:</p><img src='/assets/img/strategy/pinocchio-1-en.jpg'><p>As for the example, the model by the Pinocchio strategy involves three candles. The signal comes when a local maximum or a local minimum is hit, signalling a trend change. In this case, the shadow of the candle represents Pinocchio’s nose. The higher it is, the more likely the trend change will occur since the price does not correspond to the trend at this particular moment.</p><img src='/assets/img/strategy/pinocchio-2-en.jpg'><h2>Trading recomendations</h2><ul><li>Expiration: <strong>15-30 minutes</strong></li><li>Investment: <strong>2% от of your deposit</strong></li></ul>",

As we know, currency exchanges and stock exchanges are opened during business days only, which means the closing price on Friday may significantly change during the weekend and open with a big gap on Monday. Such rate breaks are called gaps and they quite often take place in exchange trade. They provide an opportunity to make a good profit at the very beginning of the trading week while preparing for the opening.</p><h2>How Is the Gap Strategy Used in Trading?</h2><p>If you have not used the candlestick chart view for the analysis before, make sure you activate it by choosing the relevant option in the menu bar:</p><img src='/assets/strategy/gap-1-en.jpg'><p>You should open transactions in the direction of the gap which occurred during the weekend.

The chart does not always behave as predicted upon the news release. Therefore, the ability to wait is deemed to be crucial for profitable news trading.</p><h2>Why Choose This Particular Strategy? </h2><p>News trading has proved to be one of the most popular albeit rather difficult trading strategies on currency markets.</p><p>Every day, the world receives various news that dictates short-term price movements. The market brings together the currencies of the majority of the countries, which means economic and political news of a particular country will influence the national currency rate in pairs.

When important news comes out, previously reliable indicators and trading systems happen to generate false signals. This is no surprise, because a fundamental factor may bring great volatility to the market.</p><p>This is the reason why experienced traders prefer to pause when important news is about to come out. This explains low activity on the markets when charts display prices in a sideways trend. However, this makes it possible to determine the price channel. Upon the release of news, a movement occurs and once the price channel is broken, you should immediately enter into a transaction in the strike direction.</p><p>The example shows that a news release brought a lot of buyers to the market which resulted in a broken price channel. This means you should buy a <strong>CALL</strong> option: </p><img src='/assets/strategy/news-3-en.jpg'><p>Remember that a plummeting  exchange rate resulting from the news does not last forever: usually the rate gradually reverts to the level it was at before the information was released. Therefore, if you did not manage to open a relevant type of the transaction immediately after the release of the news, it is better not to risk trying to catch the trend going away. You might want to pause and resume trading in a couple of hours when the market digests the news and regains its stability.</p><h2>Trading recommendations</h2><ul><li>Expiration: <strong>15-30 minutes</strong></li><li>Investment: <strong>2% of your deposit</strong></li></ul>",
